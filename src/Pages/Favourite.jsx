					FIC Report (Abia State) â€“ Abia State Governor, Dr. Alex Otti says the ongoing reconstruction and expansion of Port Harcourt road, Aba being handled by Julius Berger Construction Company will be completed and ready for commissioning by 29th May this year.
					Governor Otti disclosed this while speaking at the monthly media briefing tagged "Governor Otti Speaks to Abians". He reiterated his administration's commitment to driving massive infrastructural development, saying that his Government is in a hurry to transform all sectors of the State's economy.
				</p>
				<p className="text-sm text-[#1a1a1a] font-medium leading-relaxed">
					"We don't have time. We are in a hurry. So, we have to do so many things at the same time.
					"Before you know, the four years is over and you will be wondering what happened and that's why, even before we were sworn in, we brought Julius Berger to Port Harcourt road and they started the road design.
					"Some people didn't understand what we were doing. They taught we were in a hurry to take over but we were simply trying to maximize time", Gov. Otti explained.
				</p>
				<p className="text-sm text-[#1a1a1a] font-medium leading-relaxed">
					The Governor, who noted that the ongoing expansion of Library Avenue popularly known as (Bank road) will be completed before the end of March, 2025, also noted that work is progressing at various project sites across the State including the recently flagged-off Omenuko bridge. He announced that work will commence at Owaza road in Ukwa West LGA as he would be flagging off the reconstruction of the road by next week.
				</p>
				<p className="text-sm text-[#1a1a1a] font-medium leading-relaxed">
					On Power, Governor Otti said a lot is being done to increase power availability and stability across the State as arrangements are being perfected in that regards.
					On security, the State Chief Executive acknowledged appreciable level of peace and security across the State as a result of proactive measures put in place by the combined security architecture of the State.
				</p>
				<p className="text-sm text-[#1a1a1a] font-medium leading-relaxed">
					While responding to a question on why he has been working from his private home instead of renovating and retrofitting the Government House, Umuahia in Umuahia that was looted and rendered unusable by appointees of the immediate past administration, Governor Otti insisted that his priorities are delivering results to Abians and not where he operates from.
